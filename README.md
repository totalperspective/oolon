> Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mind-bogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some have chosen to see it as the final proof of the NON-existence of God. The argument goes something like this:
>
> "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."
>
> "But," says Man, "the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves that You exist, and so therefore, by Your own arguments, You don't. QED"
>
> "Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.
>
> "Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.
